 ● FOR THE REST OF THE PROJECT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO OPEN MOST OF THESE FILES ON A NOTEPAD+ OR NOTEPAD++ TO SEE THE CODE.
  ● In order to see the rest of the project, go back onto the ​DatatablesCRUD-master​ file, and open up the ​CSS file​ to see some implementations.
- The ​global.css​ is coded for the colors and how the code looks as a whole
- The ​jquery.dataTables.min.css​ includes table styles which are in depth.
● Once you click back, there is a ​detail.html​ file, and that is a null file to show the community service portion of the project without any data.
● Once you are out of the ​detail.html​ file, ​Images​ ​is the next file that includes images that were used in this project alone.
● Once you are out of the ​Images​ ​file, there is the main important file with the code that put this whole project together called ​JS
● Click on ​JS ​and every part of the code is on there.
- csv.js​ includes the function and console with Flat JSON
- data.txt​ includes the inputs of data that is on the website right now.
- defaultValues.js​ includes the multiple variables needed that would help with the
persistent storage.
- fileSaver.js​ has the ability to keep all the edit/delete/view portions of the project to stay
intact for users to see once ​index.html ​has been opened.
- global.js​ is a variable and function code that has arrays and if statements so there is an
ability to explain that something the user has done wrong, and how to fix it if that
situation occurs.
- jquery-1.12.3.js​ contains everything of the common JavaScript library and functions to
return once the code has received an input.
- jquery.dateTables.min.js​ has everything from data tables, XML files, NoSQL database
and documents with multi variables to make sure the code runs smoothly.
