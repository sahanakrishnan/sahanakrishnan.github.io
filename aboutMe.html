					<h2> My name is Sahana Krishnan, and I am currently a first year at Georgia Tech. My current major
						is Computer Science
						, and I plan on doing a concentration in Intelligence and Info-networks. One thing I like to do
						in my free time is to go out with
						my friends and just relax. This past semester, I had taken 12 credits in college: CS 1331, MATH
						1554, CHEM 1211k, and CS 1100. The following
						semester I plan on taking more but my classes have not been finalized. I also plan on joining
						some clubs and applying to internships in order to
						further develop my interest in Computer Science as well as understanding the process of the job
						market. It is important that I reach such goals
						so that it will be easier once I finish my four years of college. After college, my first goal
						is to get a good job with a high pay, and once I
						recieve some work experience, I want to go back to school to finish my MBA so I can be more
						flexible in whatever career I go into. bling
